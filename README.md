Q: Why is this being done? 
A: Simply put the developer of these lovely application either, doesnt exist/care anymore and hasnt made any changes to the websites since 2013 and lastly uploaded a slightly ajusted 2018 roll out version of the apk.
and has not responded to any emails or alternative contact forums, hence i dont care either. and since 2023 both wesbites are down and only avalible via the Top Dog Archive.org and there aren't any open-scource alternatives to the applications.
and after long years of not changing anything to thy websites or thy apk's thy right to ownership means simply put: "Nothing"
